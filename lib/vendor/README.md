Third-Party Libraries
=====================

Like most software, this script relies on third-party libraries (TPLs) to do the job it's designed to do without writing more code than necessary. The following files are no exceptions:

* `csvsup.js`
* `strsup.js`

These files are downloaded from [convertcsv.com](http://www.convertcsv.com/generate-test-data.htm) and are copyright of [Data Design Group Inc.](http://www.ddginc-usa.com/). These files are unmodified from their source. Since there's nothing explicitly prohibiting the downloading/use of these scripts in the [term of use](http://www.convertcsv.com/terms-of-use.htm) and the files don't have any license information in their headers.
